### **Question:**

>***Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 7, between a given range 0 and n.***

----------------------

### Hints:
>***Consider use class, function and comprehension.***

# Question 21

### **Question:**

>***A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps. The trace of robot movement is shown as the following:***
```
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
```
>***The numbers after the direction are steps. Please write a program to compute the distance from current position after a sequence of movement and original point. If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer.***
***Example:***
***If the following tuples are given as input to the program:***
```
UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2
```
>***Then, the output of the program should be:***
```
2
```

----------------------
### Hints:
>***In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.Here distance indicates to euclidean distance.Import math module to use sqrt function.***
