# Question 38

### **Question:**

>***With a given tuple (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), write a program to print the first half values in one line and the last half values in one line.***

----------------------

### Hints:
>***Use [n1:n2] notation to get a slice from a tuple.***

-------------------


------------------

# Question 39

### **Question:**

>***Write a program to generate and print another tuple whose values are even numbers in the given tuple (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10).***

----------------------

### Hints:
>***Use "for" to iterate the tuple. Use tuple() to generate a tuple from a list.***

-------------------
